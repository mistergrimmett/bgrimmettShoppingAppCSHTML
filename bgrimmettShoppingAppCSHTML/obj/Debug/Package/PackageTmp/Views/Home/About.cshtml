        Since 1980, Precious Time has put in the dedication, blood, sweat and tears necessary to build a successful company with
        the highest of standards in customer service and satisfaction. From humble beginnings, to the rich history our company has
        built, we are constantly finding new ways to master the craft of watchmaking.

        Our company began in small town North Carolina, between a barber shop and a bakery. We had little resources, and even less
        money. But dedication doesn't take no for an answer, and our efforts have shown that to be true. After a few years of uphill
        battles, an investor by the name of Martin Rawlins sought our partnership. Together, Martin and I built Precious Time into
        the well-oiled machine that it is today!
